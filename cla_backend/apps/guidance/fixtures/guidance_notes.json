Note that NASS benefits will only allow someone to automatically qualify for legal aid through the means test if the matter is an immigration one.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-on_passported_benefits\">Are you or your partner on any of these benefits? (Read out this list to client)</h3>\n\n* Income Support\n* Income-Based Job Seeker's Allowance *(but not contributions-based)*\n* Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance\n* Guarantee Credit\n* Universal Credit\n\nBeing on any of the benefits listed above means that a person automatically qualifies through the income part of the means test, although they can still be ineligible if they have too much capital. These benefits are known as \"passporting benefits\". \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-over_60\">Are you or your partner aged 60 or over?</h3>\n\nA person who is over 60 is entitled to extra capital allowances on the means test, based on their income.\n\n## Your properties\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_worth\">How much is the property worth?</h3>\n\nUse the client's estimate, or an online price comparison site.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_mortgage_left\">How much is left to pay on the mortgage?</h3>\n\nInclude the full amount owing - a property with shared ownership will still have one mortgage. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_disputed\">Is this property disputed?</h3>\n\nIs a partner seeking to claim the property? Is a creditor or mortgage company seeking to force the sale? If so, additional allowances will apply. Look in guidance for 'SMOD' for more guidance on scenarios.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_main\">Is this your main property?</h3>\n\nLegal aid is based on how much money you have. That means any property you own must be considered, even if you don't live in it. \n\nYour main property is the home you live in. This includes caravans, houseboats or other vehicles. \n\nIf you're separated and now living somewhere else, your former home is no longer your main property. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_share\">What percentage of the property do you (and/or your partner) own?</h3>\n\nSelect 100% if the property is solely owned by the client or their partner, or jointly owned with their partner.\n\nIf the property is jointly owned with an opponent, enter 50% (assuming equal share held) or enter an appropriate percentage if another party has an interest in the property.\n\n## Savings\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-undisputed_savings\">Undisputed savings</h3>\n\nUndisputed savings are savings where the ownership is not disputed by anyone eg an ex-partner is not trying to claim them as part of the financial settlement of a divorce or separation. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-disputed_savings\">Disputed savings</h3>\n\nDisputed savings are savings where the ownership of the savings is disputed by someone eg an ex-partner is seeking to claim a share as part of a divorce or separation.

If the client states that they have not taken any drawings from the business for their personal use then enquiries should be made of the client to determine how they have met their day to day living costs during the relevant period.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-benefits\">Benefits</h3>\n\nOther state benefits received each week must be included as a source of income unless exempted.\n\nSome benefits do not need to be declared as income - search the guidance for 'disregarded benefits' to see a list of these.

Clients who have been deprived of their liberty (e.g. they are in prison or a secure hospital);\n1. Children under the age of 18; and\n1. Clients who have assessed by the gateway in the previous 12 months as requiring face-to-face advice, who have a further linked problem and are seeking further help from the same face-to-face provider.\n\nAn exempt client does not have to access advice remotely. These clients can access face to face advice without going through CLA.\n\nHowever, if an exempt client calls CLA they should be treated as any other client, with the exemption noted on the system. The client can express a preference for face to face advice at any point during the case.\n\n**If you have a debt exempt client** then you need to determine if they wish to receive advice face-to-face or remotely. If remotely then refer to a CLA Specialist. If face-to-face then offer the client a managed referral to a local debt provider from the Find a legal adviser tool. *(A managed referral is where you contact the Provider on the client\u2019s behalf - for further info ask your team leader)*\n\n**In discrimination and education**, the only legal aid providers are the CLA providers therefore if a client is exempt, they should be referred to one of the CLA providers who will arrange for a face to face appointment.\n",

(a reminder)\nMediation can be a helpful way of resolving issues about money or arrangements for children. It can be quicker and cheaper than going to court and much less stressful for everyone involved. \n\n##What should you (the operator) tell clients about mediation?\n\nFirst ask if the caller has heard of mediation and check that they understand what it is. \n\nIf the caller does not have a clear understanding of mediation, you should use the following messages:\n\n\"In mediation, you and your family members can explain your concerns and needs to each other. The mediator will give you a safe and neutral setting to talk in and they won't take sides.\"\n\n\"Family mediators are trained to work with people whose relationships have broken down. They will listen to both sides of the argument and help you to reach your own agreement.\"\n\nThen you can explain about the link with legal aid, as follows:\n\n\"If you are eligible you can get legal aid for family mediation as well as legal advice to support the mediation process. This can include the cost of making any agreement that you reach in mediation legally binding by applying to the court - this is called applying for a consent order.\"\n\n\"The court will expect you to attend a 'mediation information and assessment meeting' if, after separating from your partner, you are applying for a court order about:\n\n* money\n* property\n* possessions, or \n* arrangements about children\n\nIf you haven't been to one of these meetings the court may ask you to do so before it proceeds with your case.\"\n\n##Where should you direct clients for mediation?\nYou can then direct clients to their nearest contracted quality assured family mediation service using the directory (Find An Adviser tool). \n\n\n",

For example, if the client hopes to gain a share in an ex-partner's savings account but the account is not registered in the client's name, you should not include this under 'disputed savings'.\n\nIn a family dispute where the former matrimonial home is SMOD, if the client is seeking 50% of the property but the property is currently registered in the opponent\u2019s sole name, treat the client\u2019s interest in the asset as nil and do not include the asset under the client's property.\n\nSMOD only applies to capital assets (disputed property and disputed savings). Income cannot be regarded as SMOD since the issue here is simply whether the client is currently receiving the income or not. For example if the client is challenging the level of maintenance they are receiving ie seeking an increased amount, just include the amount currently being received in the assessment.\n\n",
