Scope Graphs
============

* When updating the tree structure, itâ€™s a good idea to change the file name (and reference in base.py settings file)
* Edit the .graphml files, e.g. using a tool like [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/), to change the scope diagnosis trees
* Run Django management command `python manage.py translations update` to update translations and templated graph files
